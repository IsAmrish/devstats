- When adding a project to an existing database that contains merge result from multiple projects, you need to manually remove eventual duplicates using: [./devel/remove_db_dups.sh](https://github.com/cncf/devstats/blob/master/devel/remove_db_dups.sh), as suggested by [cmd/merge_pdbs/merge_pdbs.go](https://github.com/cncf/devstats/blob/master/cmd/merge_pdbs/merge_pdbs.go#L197).
